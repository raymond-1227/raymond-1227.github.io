# Raymond's Site

Just my personal website, nothing personal.

---

## Website Type

I currently maintain the following two types of personal page:

- **Landing Page**: Based on Brizy

- **Documentation Page**: Based on Docusaurus

## Version History

- **v1**: Based on Jekyll Templates, based on GitHub Pages and it's only a page with useless informations. It's technically gone as I probably wiped the commit history on accident back then.

- **v2**: Based on VuePress, also hosted on GitLab Pages instead due to limitations with GitHub Pages back then. This version included a lot more information compared to v1.

- **v3**: Based on Brizy, simplified the v2 by moving project READMEs back to its own repository, and now it's only a single about page too.

## Documentation-based Version

To keep all informations still available from v2, I decided to make two types of personal website, one as a landing page for a summary of things, and another one for really detailed documentation. Since I was too lazy to find out what is causing reason of GitLab failing CI builds, so I made a new website based on Docusaurus instead of VuePress.

### Old Documentation-based v2 Website

After finding out that VuePress doesn't work with GitHub, instead I hosted on GitLab with the help by [@AdminRAT](https://gitlab.com/AdminRAT).

**Old v2 Project Link**: [raymond-1227/raymond-1227.gitlab.io](https://gitlab.com/raymond-1227/raymond-1227.gitlab.io)
